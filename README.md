# CrimeCatch

Our goal is to detect crime from security cameras and alert the cops before anything bad happens. Our crime detection system is designed with state of the art deep learning models, ResNet-50 and YOLO-v4, and trained on the UCF-Crime dataset which consists of 1900 long and untrimmed real-world surveillance videos, with 13 realistic anomalies including Abuse, Arrest, Arson, Assault, Road Accident, Burglary, Explosion, Fighting, Robbery, Shooting, Stealing, Shoplifting, and Vandalism.

## Model Performance:

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| --- | ----------- | --- | ----------- |
| Crime scene | 95.6 | 77.1 | 85.4 |
| No Crime | 82.8 | 96.8 | 89.2 |
| Accuracy | 87.6 |
